# Artificial Intelligence with Python
 - This is the code repository for [Artificial Intelligence with Python](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/artificial-intelligence-python?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781786464392), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github).
 - It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish with newly found libraries... some of it's earlier packages and modules had depreciated as advanced in AI evolved.
 - I have managed to add new modules which perform the same required outputs as earlier expected
 - HAVE FUN ðŸ˜ŠðŸ¥³

## About the Book
 - During the course of this book, you will find out how to make informed decisions about what algorithms to use in a given context.
 - Starting from the basics of Artificial Intelligence, you will learn how to develop various building blocks using different data mining techniques.
 - You will see how to implement different algorithms to get the best possible results, and will understand how to apply them to real-world scenarios.
 - If you want to add an intelligence layer to any application thatâ€™s based on images, text, stock market, or some other form of data, this exciting book on Artificial Intelligence will definitely be your guide!
